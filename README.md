# MazeRunner
* Programmed a Python coded maze game where players can move within the maze using the keys W(Up), A(Left), S(Down),
and D(Right).Integrated a timer to the game where it tracks how long the player takes to finish the maze. Incorporated a leaderboard system where it tracks/updates the fastest times taken to finish the maze by the players.
